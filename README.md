# MYSQLEmployeeTracker

This program is an employee tracking system made with Node JS and MySQL. It is a command-line application where the user selects between Departments, Roles, and Employees. There are add, view and update functions that correspond with each database. At the time of deployment, the update function is partially functional. The department section is able to be updated, and the role titles are able to be updated. Role salary as well as the employee database are unable to be updated. 

Future updates will allow complete functionality.
